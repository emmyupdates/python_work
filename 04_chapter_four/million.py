#Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use a for loop to print the numbers.
#for million in list(range(1, 1_000_001)):
    #print(million)

#Make sure your list actually starts at one and ends at one million
#Also, see how quickly Python can add a million numbers
millions = range(1, 1_000_001)
